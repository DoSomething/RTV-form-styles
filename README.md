# RTV-form-styling
CSS styles for the Rock The Vote (RTV) form. Although the file is uploaded directly to their platform and managed there, we wanted to track changes made to this file in this repository. Additional information on how to customize styles and assets can be found [here](https://www.rockthevote.org/programs-and-partner-resources/tech-for-civic-engagement/partner-ovr-tool-faqs/partner-ovr-tool-faqs/).

Partner form style overrides live in `partner2.css`. This is uploaded and submitted for approval via the RTV partner portal. Any assets (like images) can be referenced in our override file once they are also uploaded in the asset section of the RTV partner portal.
